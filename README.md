# Sekai Project Game Bug Reports
Weâ€™re using Github Discussions as a place to centralize our bug reporting. We currently get reports via email, discord, steam forums, and social media. It was becoming overwhelming to track as we have over 100 games on Steam alone and more on other platforms.

When making a bug report please include OS, platform (GOG/Steam/ETC), game name, and if possible saves/screenshots of the bug you encountered.

Please note: reports without constructive feedback, complaints about localization, or personal attacks to staff will be closed and marked invalid. If you think you found a localization issue please explain in detail why it should be changed. We also cannot address every bug reported either due to lack of engine source or other issues. We will be clear if that is the case.
